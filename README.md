# Understanding the Sources of GHG Emissions in Food Production: Problem identification and objectives

In the last 70 years, economic growth and new technologies have met the surge in demand for food, energy, and water caused by the exponential growth of the world population. However, climate change poses a direct threat to agricultural production and livestock, which alone contributes significantly to global CO emissions. The project aims to use various datasets to gain insight into global food and feed production and their environmental impact. 

## Questions to Answer: 
How has food and feed production changed over the years?
Which countries are the largest producers of food and feed? 
What are the most commonly produced foods and feedingstuffs?  
Which stages of food production contribute the most to greenhouse gas emissions? 
Which types of food production have the most negative impact on the environment? 

## Hypotheses: 
Largest producers of food and feed are likely to be developed countries with established agricultural industries. 
The most commonly produced foods and feedingstuffs are likely to be staple crops such as grains, as well as feed crops such as soybeans and corn.
Food and feed production has increased over time, particularly in response to growing global population and changing dietary habits. 
Processing and transportation stages of food production contribute the most to greenhouse gas emissions, due to their reliance on fossil fuels. 
Meat production and processing have the most negative impact on the environment, due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and land use requirements.

## Data
To gather relevant data for the project, I selected three datasets to support the analysis. The first dataset, obtained from the FAOSTAT website, which covers global food and feed production from 1961 to 2013. The second datasetas is a separate uptodate dataset of food and fees production from 2010 to 2021. The thired dataset, provided by Our World in Data, focuses on greenhouse gas emissions associated with 43 commonly produced foods worldwide. To obtain a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset on food and feed production spanning from 1961 to 2021, it was necessary to merge two separate datasets. This required performing several data transformations, including data cleaning and preparation, to ensure that the resulting dataset is accurate, complete, and ready for subsequent analysis. 
During the data cleaning and preparation phase, various techniques were employed to ensure data quality, such as identifying and handling missing values, resolving inconsistencies and errors. The dataset was also structured and formatted in a way that facilitates efficient and effective analysis, including proper data types, units, and naming conventions. 
These preparatory steps were crucial in ensuring the reliability and validity of the subsequent visualization phase. By having a well-curated dataset, it was possible to generate informative and insightful visualizations that effectively communicate trends, patterns, and insights related to global food and feed production. 
I will be using data analysis techniques to explore and answer the questions posed earlier. Through this analysis, I aim to provide insights about global food and feed production. For those interested in exploring the findings further, here is the links to the relevant articles produced as a result of this analysis.
